1. Totally, 8+(8+1)+7 = 24 units will be cost for 16 consecutive push operations.
   For 32 consecutive push operations, 8+(8+1)+7+(16+1)+15 = 56 units will be needed.
   O(n). Because when N gets larger, the copy and push operations will be continuously performed until the capacity can hold N elements.

2. It will cost 8+(8+1)+1+(10+1)+1+(12+1)+1+(14+1)+1 = 60 units for 16 pushes.
   For 32, the cost will be 8+(8+1)+1+(10+1)+1+(12+1)+1+(14+1)+1+(16+1)+1+(18+1)+1+...+(28+1)+1+(30+1)+1=500 units.
   The big-oh complexity is O(n^2).

3. First execute N/2 times of Push to fill the array, then repeatedly run Push and Pop each once in sequence. 
   The array will continuously double and shrink by half of the capacity as the response to Push and Pop. 
   One way to avoid this problem is to shrink the capacity to, for example, 1.5 times of the current size of the array.
