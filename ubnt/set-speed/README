These bash scripts will generate a txt file of IP addresses, and then ssh into any Ubiquiti(m series) device and set the burst limit


create-list.sh will generate a txt file of IP's
ubnt.sh will ssh into each IP in the ip.txt file and download, and specify bursting and traffic limit. 

Install sshpass to allow passwords to be sent as strings
For debian - apt-get install sshpass
For everything else - I have no idea...

Setting up a script to be downloaded
Place the setspeed_m file into a publicly accessible area. Example http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/setspeed_m 



Basic process and usage

1) Run the create-list.sh script. This makes text file entries for all IPs specified
2) Remove any IPs you wish not to use from the ip.txt files
3) Make sure that you set the setspeed_m loction variable
4) Run the ubnt.sh script and watch as it slowly goes through and sets the speed


Oh yeah, also checks for skynet and deletes that too...
